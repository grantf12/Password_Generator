# Password_Generator


This was the first time that I have used Javascript to create something like this, I used variables, arrays, for and while loops, prompt and confirm scripts, and a few functions.
When the button is pressed, the function (writePassword) begins by asking how long you would like the password to be, followed by what kind of characters should be included. After the variables have been confirmed true or false, they are concatenated into a new array called "charCodes". This array is then put through a for loop to generate a random password using the selected arrays from the earlier responses and finally concatenated into a new password.

I had a lot of trouble trying figure out concat(), but in the end realized I was doing it right but needed to move the generatePassword() function to the top and rearrange the variables.
